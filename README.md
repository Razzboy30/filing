**Introduction** <br>
Filing is an file application where you can get links for your files to download and share with anyone. 
This application uses node.js through express and aws services on the backend and utilises mongodb as a database which stores all the links generated for download.

**Technologies Used** <br>
On the frontend it used technologies like bootstrap as a css framework and jquery.
On the interface, we first select the file and then a alert box for the file selected appears. Then we can click the Submit button and application will give us the link.
We can also check all the links generated by clicking the Get Link button. 
The link generated is valid upto 7 days and after that the link will stop working.
It can also only take in file types like .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .pdf.

**Run Locally**<br>
In order to run this app locally, you have to install all require modules and write "node app.js", if using nodemon do "nodemon app.js".
After this the application is hosted locally on port 3000. 
So on your browser go to "http://localhost:3000/" and your application will start running smoothly.
